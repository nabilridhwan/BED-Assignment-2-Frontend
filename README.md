# BED Assignment 2 (Frontend) 
Theme taken from [here](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-bootstrap-4-html5-online-shopping-website-template-aroma/).

-   Add category, discount, products (for admin only)
-   Home page shows recommended products based on the user's interest (interests can be adjusted in the profile page)
-   Encrypted password using _bcryptjs_.

-   Images upload (for both products and profile pictures)
-   Search for discounted products
-   Cart (and saving to database) and the data showing in the profile page.
